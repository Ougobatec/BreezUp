# üå¨Ô∏è BreezUp ‚Äì Lightweight & Reactive Social Network

**BreezUp** is a minimalist social network inspired by Twitter/X, designed to work efficiently even in low-resource environments. It allows posting short messages, user interactions, and smooth, fast navigation.

## üöÄ Project Goals

* Provide a lightweight alternative to traditional social networks.
* Ensure an excellent user experience on mobile.
* Optimize the app for constrained environments (low bandwidth, limited hardware).
* Design a modular, scalable, and easily deployable architecture.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Back-end (Node.js + Express)
* **Node.js**, **Express.js**: Lightweight and efficient RESTful API
* **MongoDB** + **Mongoose**: Flexible NoSQL database
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure authentication
* **Docker**: Containerization for development and production
* Security: CORS, fine error management
* **Modular monolithic architecture** grouping the following models:

  * `User`
  * `Post`
  * `Comment`
  * `Subscription`
  * `Notification`
  * `Message`
  * `Report`

### Front-end (React + Next.js)
* **React.js**, **Next.js**: Fast rendering, SSR & SSG
* **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid and responsive design
* **Axios**: Smooth API communication
* **React Router / Next Router**: Smooth navigation
* Mobile-first and responsive by default

## üîê Session Management
* Authentication via JWT
* Secure token storage (HTTP-only)
* Automatic redirection based on session state

* **Backend (Express.js)**: centralized REST API with all business models
* **MongoDB**: shared database
* Communication via **Axios** (client) ‚Üí **REST API**

## üßë‚Äçüé® Interfaces & UX

* Mobile-first design
* Clear, intuitive interfaces
* Fast user feedback

## üóìÔ∏è Workflow

* Task distribution by feature
* Versioning via Git
* Manual and unit tests

## üì¶ Launching the Project

### Prerequisites

Each service requires a `.env` **and** `.env.production` file at the root:

* In `breezup-backend` and `breezup-frontend`, **copy** the `.env.template` file to `.env` (and `.env.production` if needed) then **fill in the variables** according to your configuration.
* Adapt the `nginx.conf` file if you use NGINX for deployment, depending on the ports/services used.

### Choose launch mode:

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Locally (development without Docker):

```bash
cd breezup-backend
npm run dev

cd ../breezup-frontend
npm run dev
```

#### üê≥ With Docker (local containerized deployment):

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The MongoDB database will be accessible via Docker on port `27017` or locally on port `27019` (see `docker-compose.yml`).
